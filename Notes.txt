This is an update to accommodate those cases where the INV_TOUCHSCAN virtual location isn't used. In these cases, Scott has to enter the cost change into
HEMM and then calculate the patient price before manually updating the location_procedure_code in MPOUS
Here’s an overview of what this portion of the program’s doing – (The existing PCUConsole app would run as it does now with this additional bit added on at the end)

1) 	On the MPOUS side, create a list of active Alias_ID's and the Location_Procedure_Codes:
		SELECT DISTINCT AIA.Item_Id, ALIAS_ID, Location_Procedure_Code 
		FROM [PointOfUseSupply].[dbo].[D_INVENTORY_ITEMS] DII
		JOIN AHI_ITEM_ALIAS AIA ON AIA.Item_Id = DII.Item_Id
		WHERE Billable_Flag = 1
		AND ACTIVE_FLAG = 1 
		AND LEN(Location_Procedure_Code) > 0		

2)	On the HEMM side, create a list of ITEM_NO's and PAT_CHRG_PRICE's
		SELECT distinct  ITEM_NO, PAT_CHRG_PRICE
		FROM SLOC_ITEM
		JOIN ITEM ON ITEM.ITEM_ID = SLOC_ITEM.ITEM_ID
		WHERE  ISNULL(PAT_CHRG_PRICE,0) > 0
		AND SLOC_ITEM.STAT IN (1,2)

3)	Compare the two lists. Create a list for those items that don't match on the Patient Charge value.
	This list will have the MPOUS Item_Id and the HEMM PAT_CHRG_PRICE.

4)	Use the list from step 3 to update the Location_Procedure_Code on the MPOUS side.
		UPDATE D_INVENTORY_ITEMS SET Location_Procedure_Code = '40526_30_C1887^7464'
		WHERE Billable_Flag = 1  AND Item_Id = 79950

		/*then there's this line for testing*/
		UPDATE [uwm_BIAdmin].[dbo].[uwm_D_INVENTORY_ITEMS] SET Location_Procedure_Code = 'xxxx'
		WHERE Billable_Flag = 1  AND Item_Id = xxxx
